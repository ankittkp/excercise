In the hello.js where the 
const http = require('http');

the http module contain the function to create the server.

const http = 'localhost';
const port = 8000;

the web servers accept requests from browser and other clients. The webserver by entering a domain name converted into an IP address by a DNS server. An Ip address is a unique number that identify a machine on a network like the internet. 

The value localhost is a special private address the conputers use for local server. It's equivalent to 127.0.0.1.

The port is the no. use an endpoint to our IP address and 8000 for our web servers. It's default and in most case deverlopers use it for HTTP servers.

const requestListener = function(req,res){
	res.writeHead(200);
	res.end('server started');

}

this function handle an incoming HTTP request and return an HTTP response. 
The first line res.writehead(200) sets the HTTP status code to ok.

For the JSON Part

res.setHeader("content-type", "application/json");
Here we want to return a JSON response and by changing it the HTTP header are attached to a request or a response. 

The headers name and its value. 

res.writehead(200);
res.send('{message": "This is a json response"}');

this res.send file will succesfully return the string arguments contains valid json.
